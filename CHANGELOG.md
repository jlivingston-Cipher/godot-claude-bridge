# Changelog

All notable changes to the Godot–Claude Bridge are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.9] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Phase 1 LSP-depth — two new semantic tools.**
  - `gd_signature_help` — call-signature / active-parameter hints at a position
    (`textDocument/signatureHelp`), resolving `[start,end]` parameter labels
    against the signature label. **Confirmed returning signatures live in CI**
    against a real Godot 4.3-stable editor.
  - `gd_code_action` — the lightbulb menu (`textDocument/codeAction`): quick
    fixes / refactors for a range, listed read-only with a `has_edit` flag and
    any attached `command` (both CodeAction and bare Command shapes normalized).
- **Phase 1 debugger-depth — two new DAP tools.**
  - `dbg_set_exception_breakpoints` — enable/replace the adapter's exception
    breakpoint filters (`setExceptionBreakpoints`) and report the
    `available_filters` it advertises. Config-only, not gated.
  - `dbg_set_variable` — change a variable's value in a stopped frame
    (`setVariable`). **Elicitation-gated** (destructive) and feature-detected:
    returns a clear "unsupported" message without prompting when the adapter
    advertises `supportsSetVariable: false`.
- **Live D7 probe in the editor-plane integration job.** Reports, against a real
  editor, whether `workspace/symbol` returns results and smokes the new LSP
  tools (grep-able `D7_CAPS` / `D7_WS_RAW` / `PROBE` markers; log-only, never
  gates a merge).

### Changed
- **`gd_code_action` degrades gracefully (D7 finding).** The CI probe showed
  Godot 4.3-stable advertises `codeActionProvider: false` and replies `-32601`,
  so the tool now feature-detects (mirroring `gd_workspace_symbols`) and returns
  a clear "unsupported" message instead of leaking a raw JSON-RPC error.
- **`gd_workspace_symbols` framing re-confirmed (D7).** The same probe showed 4.3
  advertises `workspaceSymbolProvider: true` yet still replies `-32601` to every
  query — validating the existing "unsupported" handling and its
  belt-and-suspenders `-32601` catch. Documented in `README.md` /
  `docs/TOOL_CATALOG.md`.
- Surface **55 → 59 tools** (8 → 10 LSP, 10 → 12 DAP). The registration meta-test,
  frozen output schemas, `docs/TOOL_CATALOG.md` (entries + index + gating list),
  and `README.md` were updated in lockstep; `contract_check.py` stays green
  (59 ↔ 59, 52 catalog JSON blocks). +8 loopback mock-server tests (**80 total**).
- Version realigned to **0.4.9** across `host/package.json` (+ lockfile), both
  `plugin.cfg`s, and both `ADDON_VERSION`s (canonical + `example/` vendored copy).

## [0.4.8] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Plugin icon shipped inside the addon (`addons/claude_bridge/icon.png`).** A
  128×128 icon (a Godot-blue node bridged to a Claude-terracotta node) added for
  the Godot Asset Library listing. It was committed to `main` after the `v0.4.7`
  tag, so it was absent from the `v0.4.7` tag tree; this release tags it in-tree
  so an Asset Library install now drops the icon into a user's
  `res://addons/claude_bridge/` alongside the addon. Non-functional asset — no
  code or tool behavior changes.

### Changed
- Version realigned to **0.4.8** across `host/package.json` (+ lockfile), both
  `plugin.cfg`s, and both `ADDON_VERSION`s (canonical + `example/` vendored copy).
  This is the tag the Asset Library submission should reference.

## [0.4.7] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **Asset Library layout (D5, option A).** Moved the canonical addon from the
  nested `addon/addons/claude_bridge/` to **`addons/claude_bridge/`** at the repo
  root (`git mv addon/addons addons`; the empty `addon/` was removed). This is the
  layout the Godot Asset Library installer expects, so an AssetLib "install" now
  drops `addons/claude_bridge/` into a user's `res://addons/` with no manual step.
  Every path reference was updated to match: `scripts/contract_check.py`,
  `scripts/validate.sh`, `README.md` (layout + setup), and `docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`
  (which now records option A as resolved). `contract_check.py` stays green
  (54 tools, 47/47 catalog JSON) and the real SDK build + `npm pack --dry-run`
  (37-file tarball) are unaffected. The `example/addons/claude_bridge/` vendored
  copy is unchanged in place.
- Version realigned to **0.4.7** across `host/package.json` (+ lockfile), both
  `plugin.cfg`s, and both `ADDON_VERSION`s (canonical + `example/` vendored copy).

## [0.4.6] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **npm publish-prep for the host.** Renamed the package
  `godot-claude-bridge-host` → **`godot-claude-bridge`** (the `bin` command was
  already `godot-claude-bridge`; the name was confirmed free on npm), added
  `license`/`repository`/`homepage`/`bugs`/`keywords`/`author` metadata, a
  `prepublishOnly: npm run build` guard so a publish can never ship stale `dist/`,
  and bundled `LICENSE` + a package `README.md` (`files` now lists them). Verified
  with `npm pack --dry-run`. The `npm publish` itself is intentionally left to the
  maintainer (needs npm auth).
- **Root README freshness pass.** Dropped the "Phases 0–4" title and the stale
  "0.4.1 pre-live-run / reference scaffold / not exercised in CI / validated by
  inspection" framing — the project is live-validated with CI running the real
  build. Reworked the Verification, Validating, and Status sections accordingly,
  documented the `gd_workspace_symbols` engine gap, and pointed install at the
  npm package.
- Version realigned to **0.4.6** across `host/package.json`, both `plugin.cfg`s,
  and both `ADDON_VERSION`s (canonical + `example/` vendored copy).

## [0.4.5] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **`gd_workspace_symbols` now degrades gracefully.** Godot's GDScript language
  server (through 4.7) has no `workspace/symbol` method and replies
  `-32601 Method not found`, which the tool previously surfaced as a raw
  `LSP error [-32601]: …`. The host now feature-detects the gap: `LspClient`
  captures the server's advertised capabilities from the `initialize` handshake
  (`getServerCapabilities()`), and the tool skips the request when
  `workspaceSymbolProvider` is absent — still catching a `-32601` (or "method not
  found") from builds that advertise the capability but don't honour it — and
  returns an explicit `isError` message pointing at `gd_document_symbols` as the
  working alternative. The success-path `symbols` output shape is unchanged, so
  the tool will start returning results unmodified on a future Godot build that
  implements the method. Output-schema enforcement is unaffected (the MCP SDK
  exempts `isError` results from `outputSchema` validation).

- **Aligned addon version metadata for distribution.** `addon/…/plugin.cfg` was
  still `version="0.1.0"` with a "Phase 0-1 scaffold" description (the file the
  Asset Library and the Godot plugin list actually read), while
  `operations.gd`'s `ADDON_VERSION` said `0.4.3`. Bumped both to **0.4.5** and
  rewrote the stale plugin/README descriptions to the shipped four-plane reality,
  so a plugin-list entry and an Asset Library submission read correctly. Repo-wide
  tags mean host and addon share the one repo version at each tag.

### Added
- **D5 — distribution guide (`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`).** Documents publishing the
  host to npm and the addon to the Godot Asset Library, and states the remote
  caveat honestly: a cloud sandbox cannot see a local editor and frame capture
  needs a GPU/Xvfb, so a remote deployment is a degraded subset without a local
  relay. No code depends on this; it captures the decisions and steps.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **D1 — pinned the SDK floor.** Raised `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from
  `^1.10.0` to `^1.17.0` so a lockfile-less `npm install` can no longer resolve a
  pre-elicitation SDK. The confirmation gate needs `server.server.elicitInput`
  and the tools need `registerTool({ inputSchema, outputSchema })`; verified that
  1.17.0 exposes both. The committed lockfile still pins the live-validated
  **1.29.0**, so `npm ci` (and CI) resolve exactly as before — this only tightens
  the floor for fresh, lockfile-less installs.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-05

First live-validated **and** hardened build. Exercised end-to-end against a real
Godot 4.7 editor and a real npm-installed `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0`
(resolved from `^1.10.0`); the full Go/No-Go checklist is GO
(see `LIVE_VALIDATION_SIGNOFF.md`). 54 tools + 5 resources across all four planes.

### Added
- **B1 — enforced output schemas.** `host/src/schemas.ts` freezes the
  `structuredContent` shape of every data tool (52 tools) and
  `applyOutputSchemas()` injects each as the tool's `outputSchema`, so the MCP
  SDK now validates every success result at runtime. Shapes were frozen from the
  v0.4.2 live run (47 exercised live, 0 mismatches). Image tools
  (`screenshot_editor`, `runtime_screenshot`) are intentionally excluded.
- **B2 — CI.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the real
  `npm ci && npm run build && npm run typecheck` plus `scripts/contract_check.py`
  on Node 18/20/22, and asserts the SDK resolves to a 1.x line.
  `.github/workflows/sdk-drift.yml` is a weekly early-warning for SDK major bumps.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

### Changed
- **B3 — TOOL_CATALOG doc-drift cleanup.** Reconciled `docs/TOOL_CATALOG.md`
  against the shipped code and the now-enforced `schemas.ts`:
  - `runtime_inject_input` input now documents `strength`, `button`, and
    `relative` (host schema and GDScript handler already supported them);
    output documents `kind`.
  - `dbg_evaluate` output documents `variables_ref`.
  - `gd_diagnostics` input documents `wait_ms` and marks `path` required; output
    corrected to a top-level `uri` (was shown per-diagnostic).
  - `gd_rename` input documents `apply`/`confirm`; output documents
    `applied`/`written`.
  - `gd_references` input corrected `includeDeclaration` → `include_declaration`.
  - `dbg_launch`/`dbg_attach`/`dbg_set_breakpoints`/`dbg_stack_trace`/
    `runtime_get_log` schemas reconciled to the shipped shapes.
  - Design note updated to reflect that output schemas are now enforced (B1).
- `ADDON_VERSION` bumped `0.1.0` → `0.4.3` in `operations.gd` (addon and example
  copies) so `editor_ping.addon_version` is meaningful.
- `host/package-lock.json` refreshed after the version bump so `npm ci` is
  deterministic (records `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0`).

### Known limitations
- `gd_workspace_symbols` is non-functional against Godot 4.7: the GDScript
  language server replies `-32601 Method not found` to `workspace/symbol`. The
  gap is in the engine, not the host; the tool's contract is correct and it is
  retained for forward compatibility. (Backlog: feature-detect and hide, or
  return a clearer "unsupported" message.)
- `godot_launch_editor` (detached) does not start Godot's LSP (6005) / DAP (6006)
  servers; use a foreground `godot --editor --path …` when those planes are
  needed.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-05

First live-validated build. Gate 0 (the real SDK build, which no static authoring
environment could run) surfaced exactly one real defect, now fixed.

### Fixed
- **`ToolResult` type (`host/src/confirm.ts`).** The confirmation-gate result
  typed `content` as optional/untyped, which compiled against the modeled SDK
  shims but broke against SDK 1.29's `registerTool`, producing nine `TS2345`
  errors across the nine elicitation-gated tools (`dap.ts`, `editor.ts`,
  `lsp.ts`, `runtime.ts`). Retyped `content` as a required
  `Array<{ type: "text"; text: string }>` with an index signature to satisfy
  `CallToolResult`. No logic changed; rebuild clean.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-04

Pre-live scaffold with two fixes later confirmed working during the live run.

### Fixed
- **Diagnostics URI key (`host/src/lsp.ts`).** `gd_diagnostics` now matches
  published diagnostics by a normalized `diagKey`, so a diagnostic published
  under a `%20`-encoded `file://` URI is still matched to the opened document
  instead of silently returning empty after the timeout.
- **DAP step/continue await-the-stop (`host/src/tools/dap.ts`).** `dbg_step` and
  `dbg_continue` now wait for the next `stopped`/`terminated` event and return
  the real resulting state, instead of returning an instant `running` reply that
  the caller had to poll.
